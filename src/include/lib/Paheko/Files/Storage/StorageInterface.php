/**
 * Storage backends must implement this interface
 *
 * In Paheko, storage backends actually store the file contents,
 * while the file metadata is stored inside the 'files' table of
 * the database.
 *
 * A backend storage MUST be able to store:
 * - the file contents
 * - the file modification date
 * - the file name and path
 *
 * This is because the 'files' table is just a cache, it can corrupt
 * or need to be refreshed after a database update.
 *
 * This means that if your storage backend does NOT store files in a file system,
 * you may have to store these metadata in another place.
 *
 * Directories: storage backends should not worry about directories,
 * directories are automatically created in cache when required.
